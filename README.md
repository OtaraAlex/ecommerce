I applied;
- Advanced React Best Practices such as
    - Folder and file structure, hooks and refs
- Advanced State Management of the entire application using React Context API
- Next.js Best Practices such as
    - File-based routing, Data fetching that allows server-side rendering and static generation which makes your websites incredibly optimized (show getServerSideProps, getStaticPaths, getStaticProps), and learnt how to use Next.js as a backend endpoint.
    

The app is integrated with *Stripe* to manage payments, products, shipping rates, and the entire checkout process

I used [Sanity](sanity.io), a CMS, to manage the entire content of my app.

Through Sanity, one will be able to change the store’s homepage and more importantly, the details of all the products in the store, instantly and on the go!

Sanity allows one to focus on developing the application without having to worry about the content, file storage, and databases. They’ll cover the 'dirty' work for you and allow you to build scalable and modern e-commerce web applications extremely easily.
